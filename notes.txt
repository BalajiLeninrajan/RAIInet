- applying decorator to cell?

- lag two components:
    - cell decorator
      - internal counter, every turn, counter dec by 1
      - when 0, getCellRepresentation will show real cell
      - need to push new update for displaying
    - link decorator
      - has an internal counter, dec by 1
        - while its counter is not 0, create cellDecorator on every cell it moves to
        - link decorator needs to store all pointers to the cellDecorator, maybe board pointer + coords?
        - when coords is undecorated at end of timer, all the old cell decorators become undecorated. So either when link is downloaded, or after timer (up to discretion)

How to signal to these two that turn has passed?
- have multi-inheritance on link decorator and cell decorator
  game can store these
  e.g. hook-mix-in
  link dec and cell de inherit from it?

How will game clean up hooks once expired?


My ideas:
- Link has decorator
  Link applies lag decorator to Cell, then moves
- wait shit then onEnter might not necessarily count down nvm
